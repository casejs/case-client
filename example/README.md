# Example frontend app that uses Manifest SDK

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It serves as a JS Frontend example that loads the Manifest SDK.

```bash
cd example
npm install
npm run start
```

It is recommended to link the current `@mnfst/sdk` package:

```bash
# From project root
npm install
npm run build
npm link # may require sudo

cd example
npm link @mnfst/sdk

```
